Third Project - freeCodeCamp - Creating a survey form

1. My first responsive webpage - Rebuild navigation bar from the second project.
2. Learned how to put a colored layer on top of background image (may not be the most optimum way but it works!)
3. More practice on positioning (absolute & relative)
